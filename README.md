# üß† Early Detection System for Alzheimer's Disease

This project leverages Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI) to build an early detection system for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. The model is designed to identify early signs using medical data and explain its decisions using SHAP and LIME.

## üìÇ Project Overview

Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease is a progressive neurological disorder. Early detection can help slow down its progression and improve patient care. This project focuses on:

- Training ML models for early detection
- Using XAI tools (SHAP, LIME) to explain model predictions
- Assisting clinicians in making informed decisions
